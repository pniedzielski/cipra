cipra2 Testing Library
======================

cipra2 is a simple, extensible, TAP-compatible testing library for
C++. cipra is Free and Open Source Software, released under a 3-clause
BSD-style license. It's written in 100% standard C++11 and is only a
couple header files, making it easy to include in your C++11 project.

TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is a standard protocol for test
results that was originally designed for Perl, but has seen widespread
use in other projects and language communities, such as Ruby, Python,
and the git project.  It is both human-readable and has a rich number
of tools ("harnesses") that parse TAP formatted output and do useful
things with it.

The name cipra (pronounced /ˈʃi.pɾaː/ "SHEE-prah") comes from the
lojban phrase "lo cipra", which means "the test". It is properly
written with an initial minuscule 'c', even when at the start of a
sentence.
